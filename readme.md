# OrangeTree, A Linked List Manager

## How to use?

 * Simple, the only thing you have to do in order to make a struct into an OrangeTree linked list is to put 2 members in the start of your struct
 * `void* OT_next`
 * `void* OT_prev`
 * Done!

## Etymology

 * Orange trees have branches, linked lists are kind of like branches idk
 * it's getting harder and harder to come up with names for this stuff
